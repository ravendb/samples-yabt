# YABT. Back-end

## Technologies

- ASP .NET Core 5.0
- RavenDB 5.1

It has minimum third-party dependencies and heaps of best practices like the [Domain Driven Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) (DDD), [Command Query Responsibility Segregation](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html) (CQRS), etc.

## Overview of the solution

| Project name    | Description                                                                                                    |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Database.Common | Shared auxiliary structures used in DB models and DTOs on the WebAPI.                                          |
| Database        | All entities and aggregates, plus DB-related settings. Note: this project is exposed only to `Domain` project. |
| Domain          | All interfaces, types and logic specific to the domain layer.                                                  |
| WebAPI          | The application layer (API).                                                                                   |

NOTE: all tests are located under ['./tests'](../tests/) folder.

## Getting Started

Firstly, check out the GIT repo.

### Compile and run the tests

1. Install [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) v5.x.<br>
   Note that while the back-end would run on any version of .NET 5, the embedded _RavenDB_ used for the test project has a strong dependency on the _.NET SDK_ version. Check the required version in the [GitHub Action](../.github/workflows/dotnet-core.yml) used to run tests.

2. Open the solution and run the tests located under ['./tests'](../tests/) folder.<br>
   The tests that work against a real embedded _RavenDB_ database and cover multiple scenarios.

### Run Web API (Swagger)

Once you can run tests of the solutions, it's time to spin off a database and run the API.

1. Setup the database:
   1. Acquire a _RavenDB_ instance . Use on of the free options:
      1. free [cloud](https://cloud.ravendb.net/) instance;
      2. [download](https://ravendb.net/download) and install locally for your OS or Docker.
   2. Create a new database on the _RavenDB_ server ([see the docs](https://ravendb.net/docs/article-page/latest/csharp/studio/server/databases/create-new-database/general-flow)). 
   3. Import test data from `/documentation/exported_data.ravendbdump` file ([see the docs](https://ravendb.net/docs/article-page/latest/csharp/studio/database/tasks/import-data/import-data-file))
   4. Set the address to the _RavenDB_ server and the DB name in `./back-end/WebApi/appsettings.Development.json`. The database config follows the structure specified in [DatabaseSettings.cs](./back-end/Database/DataBase.Common/Configuration/DatabaseSettings.cs). As an example:
   ```json
   {
      "CorsOrigin": "<url>",
      "Database": {
         "RavenDbUrls": ["a.node.com:8080", "b.node.com:8080", "c.node.com:8080"],
         "Certificate": "<path_to_cert_if_applicable>",
         "DbName": "<DbName>"
      },
      "Logging": {
         "LogLevel": {
            "Default": "Information",
            "Microsoft": "Warning",
            "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
         }
      }
   }
   ```
   
2. Launch the solution (the `WebAPI` project).
3. Open `https://localhost:5001/swagger` in the browser.

There is an unsophisticated authentication via a hard-coded API key to run the API end-points. Read a note in the Swagger prompt - it has a clue:

From here, the back-end is all yours.

Check out [notes on the front-end](../front-end/READM.md) if you'd like to run Angular UI as well.
